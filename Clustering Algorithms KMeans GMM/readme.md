Numpy implementation of Kmeans and GMM. It is interesting to use KMeans to cluster an image. KMeans plot looks similar to the original image though.    

Still remember that I was at Havard Square to complete this assigment on a summer night. Some nice icecreams and learning on Heap data structure at that time.
